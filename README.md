# Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator program written in Python. The calculator can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user inputs. It also includes an option to exit the program.

## Features

- **Addition:** Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division:** Divides the first number by the second number. (Handles division by zero by returning an error message.)
- **Exit:** Allows the user to exit the program gracefully.

## How to Use
** Once you run the program**
**Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**
    - Select the operation you want to perform by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
    - Enter the two numbers you want to operate on.
    - The result of the operation will be displayed.
    - You will be prompted to perform another calculation or exit the program.
